- excerpted from The Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace, part 2, revised edition, pp. 365–69
  - from Ikeda Sensei’s speech at a headquarters leaders meeting held in Tokyo on June 28, 1995
  - Ikeda Sensei quotes Toda Sensei
    - Toda Sensei offered this advice to young people who were struggling with regard to their work
    - > begin Toda
      - 3 criteria for selecting a job
        - > (from Tsunesaburo Makiguchi’s theory of value)
        - beauty
          - a job you like
        - benefit
          - provides security
        - good
          - contributes to society

- before you acquire all 3
  - you are certain to do
    - work you never expected
    - > end Toda
    - > (from a lecture on the Lotus Sutra, April 18, 1953)
      - 2 out of 3 ain't bad
	    - benefit + good
        - beauty + good
        - benefit + beauty + bad
      - the presence of bad
        - **is** bad
        - > begin Toda
      - be indispensable
      - don't let the disagreeable
        - deter you
        - deter your joy
      - indispensable + faith =
        - how you get 3 of 3
      - no hard work is wasted
        - all has meaning
        - > end Toda
        - > (ibidem: from a lecture on the Lotus Sutra, April 18, 1953)
        - inverse (not perfect equality; rectangle/square relationship)
          - work that is not hard
            - is wasted
            - has no meaning
- win where you are
- shine where you are

> Buddhism teaches that our lives are inherently and eternally endowed with Buddhahood
> and that this suffering-filled saha world in which we live is itself the
> Land of Eternally Tranquil Light [the Buddha land].

- Buddhism teaches
  - our lives are endowed with Buddhahood
  - eternally
    - no beginning
    - no end
  - inherently
    - not bestowed
  - this world
    - is suffering-filled
    - is the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light
    - is the Buddha land

- Uphold the Mystic Law =
  - satisfaction
  - fulfillment
  - without fail

> The true nature of such a person’s life will reveal itself in their outward
> appearance and actions, in accord with the principle of the true aspect of all
> phenomena
>> The ultimate truth or reality that permeates all phenomena and is in no way
>> separate from them. Through the explanation of the ten factors, the “Expedient
>> Means,” the second chapter of the Lotus Sutra, teaches that all people are
>> inherently endowed with the potential to become Buddhas and clarifies the truth
>> that they can tap and manifest this potential.

- Lament =
  - abilities and value go unrecognized
- Attitude determines everything

- Sensei wants, I want, Every Buddha wants
  - you to be successful
    - can't be half-hearted
    - must follow through
      - that means to the VERY END

- your job is
  - a place of
    - of training
    - of Buddhist practice
    - to put faith into practice

- practice is
  - where you
    - make mistakes
    - learn how to handle each mistake
    - learn how to avoid repeating them
  - something you will repeat until
    - you learn this
    - you put what you have learned into practice
